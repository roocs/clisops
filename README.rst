The ``clisops`` package (pronounced "clie-sops") provides a python library for running
*data-reduction* operations on `Xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/>`_ data sets or files
that can be interpreted by Xarray. These basic operations (subsetting, averaging and
regridding) are likely to work where data structures are NetCDF-centric, such as those
found in ESGF data sets.

``clisops`` is employed by the `daops <https://github.com/roocs/daops>`_ library to perform
its basic operations once ``daops`` has applied any necessary *fixes* to data in order
to remove irregularities/anomalies. Users are recommended to investigate using ``daops``
directly in order to access these *fixes* which may affect the scientific credibility of
the results.

``clisops`` can be used stand-alone to read individual, or groups of, NetCDF files directly.

* Free software: BSD
* Documentation: https://clisops.readthedocs.io.
